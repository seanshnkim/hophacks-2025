# Cursor AI Assistant Guidelines

This file contains essential guidelines that Cursor should ALWAYS follow to reduce mistakes and improve consistency.

## üéØ Core Principles

### 1. **Always Read Before Editing**
- **NEVER** edit a file without reading it first
- Understand the existing code structure, patterns, and conventions
- Check for existing imports, dependencies, and configurations
- Look for similar patterns in the codebase before making changes

### 2. **Preserve Existing Patterns**
- Follow the existing code style and conventions
- Use the same naming patterns (camelCase, snake_case, etc.)
- Maintain consistent indentation and formatting
- Keep the same import organization and structure

### 3. **Test Before Completing**
- Always check for syntax errors after making changes
- Verify imports are correct and available
- Test that the code would run without errors
- Check for linting issues and fix them

## üîß Technical Guidelines

### 4. **Import Management**
- Add imports at the top of the file in the correct order
- Group imports: standard library, third-party, local imports
- Remove unused imports
- Use absolute imports when possible

### 5. **Error Handling**
- Always include proper error handling
- Use try-catch blocks for operations that might fail
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors appropriately

### 6. **Type Safety**
- Use type hints when available (Python, TypeScript)
- Define proper interfaces and models
- Validate input data
- Use Pydantic models for API requests/responses

## üìÅ Project-Specific Guidelines

### 7. **FastAPI Backend**
- Follow the existing API structure in `main.py`
- Use Pydantic models for request/response validation
- Include proper HTTP status codes
- Add CORS middleware for frontend integration
- Use async/await for database operations

### 8. **React Frontend**
- Follow React best practices and hooks
- Use functional components with hooks
- Maintain component separation and reusability
- Use proper state management
- Include error boundaries

### 9. **AI/ML Components**
- Follow the prompt structure in `prompts.py`
- Use the existing learning block system
- Maintain consistency with the agent workflow
- Test AI responses before deployment

## üö´ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 10. **Never Do These**
- Don't create files without understanding the project structure
- Don't hardcode values that should be configurable
- Don't ignore existing error handling patterns
- Don't break existing functionality
- Don't use deprecated or outdated patterns
- Don't create circular dependencies
- Don't forget to handle edge cases

### 11. **Always Do These**
- Read the entire file before making changes
- Check for existing similar implementations
- Test your changes
- Follow the existing naming conventions
- Add proper documentation
- Consider backward compatibility
- Validate all inputs

## üîç Code Quality Standards

### 12. **Code Organization**
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Group related functionality together
- Follow the single responsibility principle

### 13. **Performance Considerations**
- Use efficient algorithms and data structures
- Avoid unnecessary API calls
- Implement proper caching when appropriate
- Optimize database queries
- Consider memory usage

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### 14. **Before Making Changes**
1. Read the current file completely
2. Understand the existing patterns
3. Check for similar implementations in the codebase
4. Plan your changes
5. Consider the impact on other components

### 15. **During Development**
1. Make incremental changes
2. Test frequently
3. Follow existing patterns
4. Add proper error handling
5. Include logging where appropriate

### 16. **After Making Changes**
1. Test the functionality
2. Check for syntax errors
3. Verify imports work
4. Run any existing tests
5. Check for linting issues

## üìù Documentation Standards

### 17. **Code Documentation**
- Add docstrings for functions and classes
- Include parameter descriptions
- Document return values
- Add usage examples for complex functions
- Keep comments up to date

### 18. **API Documentation**
- Use clear endpoint descriptions
- Include request/response examples
- Document error codes and messages
- Add parameter descriptions
- Include authentication requirements

## üé® UI/UX Guidelines

### 19. **Frontend Consistency**
- Follow the existing design patterns
- Use consistent spacing and typography
- Maintain responsive design principles
- Include proper loading states
- Add error handling for user interactions

### 20. **User Experience**
- Provide clear feedback for user actions
- Include proper validation messages
- Make forms user-friendly
- Add loading indicators for async operations
- Ensure accessibility standards

## üîí Security Guidelines

### 21. **Data Protection**
- Validate all inputs
- Sanitize user data
- Use proper authentication
- Implement authorization checks
- Protect sensitive information

### 22. **API Security**
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement rate limiting
- Validate request data
- Handle errors securely
- Log security events

## üìä Monitoring and Logging

### 23. **Logging Standards**
- Use appropriate log levels
- Include relevant context
- Don't log sensitive information
- Use structured logging when possible
- Include request IDs for tracing

### 24. **Error Monitoring**
- Log errors with stack traces
- Include relevant context
- Monitor error rates
- Set up alerts for critical errors
- Track performance metrics

## üöÄ Deployment Guidelines

### 25. **Production Readiness**
- Test all functionality thoroughly
- Check environment configurations
- Verify all dependencies
- Test error scenarios
- Ensure proper logging

### 26. **Configuration Management**
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Don't hardcode sensitive values
- Provide default values where appropriate
- Document configuration options
- Validate configuration on startup

## üéØ Remember: Quality Over Speed

It's better to take time to understand the codebase and make correct changes than to rush and introduce bugs. Always prioritize:

1. **Understanding** the existing code
2. **Following** established patterns
3. **Testing** your changes
4. **Maintaining** code quality
5. **Preserving** existing functionality

These guidelines should be followed in EVERY interaction to ensure consistent, high-quality code that integrates well with the existing project.
