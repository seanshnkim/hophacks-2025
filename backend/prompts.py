Your task is to create a comprehensive learning guide with ONLY HEADINGS (no content) for the given topic.

Guidelines:
- Break down the topic into logical learning sections
- Create clear, hierarchical headings (use #, ##, ###)
- Cover all essential aspects of the topic
- Make it progressive (beginner to advanced concepts)
- Include practical applications and examples sections
- Adapt the structure based on user preferences

Format as markdown with headings only. Example structure:
# Topic Name

### Concept 1
### Concept 2
