# Markdown Rendering Test

This notebook demonstrates the improved markdown rendering capabilities.

## Headers Work Great!

### Subheadings look nice too

#### Even smaller headings

##### And smaller ones

###### The smallest heading level

## Text Formatting

Here's some **bold text** and *italic text* and even ***bold italic text***.

You can also use _underscores for italics_ and __double underscores for bold__.

## Code Examples

Here's some `inline code` with proper styling.

```python
# This is a code block
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
    return "Success"

# Let's test numpy too
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(f"Array: {arr}")
print(f"Mean: {np.mean(arr)}")
```

## Lists

### Unordered Lists
- First item  
- Second item
- Third item
  - Nested item (if supported)
- Fourth item

### Ordered Lists
1. First numbered item
2. Second numbered item  
3. Third numbered item

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote example.
> It should be styled nicely with a left border.
> 
> Multiple paragraphs in blockquotes look good too.

## Links

Here's a [link to the project repo](https://github.com/seanshnkim/hophacks-2025) that should open in a new tab.
